        <h2>What a Portfolio Is (and What It Is Not)</h2>
        <p>
        A portfolio is a curated set of examples that helps employers understand your skills through real work.
        It is not only a gallery of final visuals. Strong portfolios show your process, decision-making, and impact.
        </p>
        <p>
        For UMSI students, a portfolio can include course projects, personal projects, research work, client work,
        and other experiences that demonstrate relevant skills.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Start with a Simple Structure</h2>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose your goal:</strong> Decide what roles you are targeting and what skills you want to show.</li>
        <li><strong>Select 3-5 projects:</strong> Pick work that best matches your goal (quality over quantity).</li>
        <li><strong>Write one short case study per project:</strong> Explain the problem, your role, your process, and the outcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Add supporting artifacts:</strong> Screenshots, diagrams, links, or short demos that strengthen your story.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it easy to contact you:</strong> Include a clear way to reach you and link to your resume if helpful.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What to Include in Each Case Study</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Context:</strong> What problem were you solving, and for whom?</li>
          <li><strong>Your role:</strong> What did you do specifically (especially in team projects)?</li>
          <li><strong>Process:</strong> What steps did you take (research, ideation, prototyping, testing, iteration)?</li>
          <li><strong>Key decisions:</strong> What tradeoffs did you make, and why?</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> What changed? What did you deliver? What impact did your work have?</li>
          <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> What would you do differently next time?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Portfolio Content Ideas by Career Direction</h2>
        <p>
          Your portfolio does not need to look the same as someone else's. Choose artifacts that match the type of role you want.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>UX / Product Design:</strong> Case studies with research insights, user needs, iterations, and final flows.</li>
          <li><strong>Data / Analytics:</strong> Clear problem framing, methods, visualizations, and what decisions the analysis supported.</li>
          <li><strong>Information Architecture / Content Strategy:</strong> Before/after structure, taxonomy decisions, and usability considerations.</li>
          <li><strong>Research:</strong> Research questions, study design, findings, and how insights informed recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Only showing final screens:</strong> Employers also want to see how you think and how you got there.</li>
          <li><strong>Unclear ownership:</strong> If it was a group project, clearly state what you personally contributed.</li>
          <li><strong>Too many projects with little depth:</strong> A few strong case studies are better than many shallow ones.</li>
          <li><strong>Missing outcomes:</strong> Include results whenever possible (metrics, feedback, what improved, what shipped).</li>
          <li><strong>Hard-to-scan pages:</strong> Use headings and short sections so readers can scan quickly.</li>
        </ul>
