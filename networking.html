      <h2>Why Networking Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Networking is not just about asking for jobs. It is about learning, building relationships,
        and understanding different career paths. Strong professional connections help students
        access information, mentorship, and opportunities that are often not posted publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
        For UMSI students, networking can support career exploration, internship searches, job
        preparation, and long-term professional growth.

      <h2>Start with Low-Stress Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Set one goal:</strong> learn about a role, an industry, or a career path.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify 3-5 people:</strong> alumni, classmates, faculty, or professionals in your field of interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Send a short message:</strong> ask for a brief conversation (15–20 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare a few questions:</strong> focus on their experiences and advice.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow up:</strong> send a thank-you message and maintain the connection.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Outreach Message Template</h2>
      <p>You can copy and customize this message:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Hi [Name],<br>
          My name is [Your Name] and I'm a UMSI student interested in learning more about [role/field].
          I found your profile through [where you found them].<br><br>
          If you have time, would you be open to a 15-20 minute conversation about your experience and career path?<br><br>
          Thank you,<br>
          [Your Name]
        </p>
      </blockquote>

        <h2>Informational Interviews</h2>
        <p>
            Informational interviews are short conversations focused on learning, not job requests.
            They help you understand roles, workplaces, and career paths while building authentic connections.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Focus on learning:</strong> ask about their journey and daily work.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect their time:</strong> keep meetings short and focused.</li>
            <li><strong>Build relationships:</strong> networking is long-term, not transactional.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Common Networking Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Only reaching out when you need a job:</strong> build relationships early.</li>
            <li><strong>Sending long messages:</strong> keep outreach short and clear.</li>
            <li><strong>Not following up:</strong> relationships grow through continued contact.</li>
            <li><strong>Being vague:</strong> make your purpose clear and specific.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
            Start small. Reach out to one person this week, attend one event this month,
            and schedule one career conversation this semester. Networking grows through
            consistent, simple actions.
